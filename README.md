## Introduction
This is a project created for ProductHack 2024

## Inspiration
Drawing inspiration from our team's diverse interests and experiences with social platforms, we embarked on a mission to redefine authenticity in social media while infusing our distinct passions into the mix. One of us delves into obscure subreddits, uncovering hidden communities; another finds passion in documenting real-life moments with friends, meanwhile, one member embraces a social media detox, seeking a refuge from the noise and distractions.

With these disparate yet compelling influences in mind, we pondered: How can we craft a social app that embodies authenticity with our own unique flair? This question became the cornerstone of our brainstorming sessions, fueling our creativity and innovation.

Instead of replicating existing platforms, we aimed to carve out our niche, offering users an experience resonating with our collective values and interests. Our vision was not just about fostering connections, but about fostering meaningful connections grounded in authenticity, shared passions, and the best memes.

Thus, our social app was born—a platform that celebrates the eclectic beauty of niche communities, encourages genuine interactions, and empowers users to curate their digital spaces in alignment with their true selves. 

## What it does
Clik is a social media app centered around **fun and locally curated prompts** to inspire and engage the creators of our community every week - showing users what’s **trending and relevant** in their city and fostering a sense of belonging like never before.

- ✅ Interactive Design
- ✅ Ranking system on the post
- ✅ Engage user with new prompt every week

## How we built it
- We built it using React, TailwindCSS for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end.

## What we learned
- Throughout the projects, our teams learned to work together and improve time management skills. We continuously planned and enhanced the design to achieve an MVP by the end of the hackathon.

## Challenges we ran into
- One of the biggest challenges in this hackathon is time. We must deliver a Minimum Viable Product within a 24-hour period. However, we overcame it with persistence. By selecting the right tech stacks, refining our planning skills, and managing our time effectively, we overcome this obstacle.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Responsiveness and awesome UI
- Great teamwork
- Minimum functionality: user able to post, stores the data, etc.

## What's next for Clik 
- Improve the design and adding more features that improve UX
- Design so it is more responsive to all screen size
- Improve the structure and implementation details to optimize due to handle multiples and concurrent API calls
