## Introduction
This is a project created for ProductHack 2024

## Inspiration
Drawing inspiration from our team's diverse interests and experiences with social platforms, we embarked on a mission to redefine authenticity in social media while infusing our distinct passions into the mix. One of us delves into obscure subreddits, uncovering hidden communities; another finds passion in documenting real-life moments with friends, meanwhile, one member embraces a social media detox, seeking a refuge from the noise and distractions.

With these disparate yet compelling influences in mind, we pondered: How can we craft a social app that embodies authenticity with our own unique flair? This question became the cornerstone of our brainstorming sessions, fueling our creativity and innovation.

Instead of replicating existing platforms, we aimed to carve out our niche, offering users an experience resonating with our collective values and interests. Our vision was not just about fostering connections, but about fostering meaningful connections grounded in authenticity, shared passions, and the best memes.

Thus, our social app was born—a platform that celebrates the eclectic beauty of niche communities, encourages genuine interactions, and empowers users to curate their digital spaces in alignment with their true selves. 

## What it does
Clik is a social media app centered around **fun and locally curated prompts** to inspire and engage the creators of our community every week - showing users what’s **trending and relevant** in their city and fostering a sense of belonging like never before.

- ✅ Interactive Design
- ✅ Ranking system on the post
- ✅ Engage user with new prompt every week

## How we built it
- We built it using React, TailwindCSS for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end.

## What we learned
- Throughout the projects, our teams honed their collaboration and time management skills. We consistently planned and enhanced the design to achieve a Minimum Viable Product by the hackathon's conclusion.

## Challenges we ran into
- One of the biggest challenge in this hackathon is time. We have to delivery a MVP during this 24 hour period. However, we overcome it with persistant. By choosing the right tech stacks, planning skills and time management, we overcome this problem.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Responsiveness and beautiful UI
- Great teamwork
- Learned Lots!
